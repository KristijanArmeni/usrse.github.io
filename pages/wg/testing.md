# Overview

The Testing Working Group aims to leverage valuable industry software testing
practices and methodologies, bridging the gap between research and industry
standards. The group seeks to tackle the distinct challenges of research
software testing by harnessing AI technologies. Some key focus areas include
testing legacy code, ensuring comprehensive code coverage, and enhancing
overall verification and validation processes. This collaborative effort
will bring together RSEs, researchers, and practitioners to discuss current
limitations, share knowledge, and collectively address cutting-edge challenges,
thereby advancing the reliability and quality of research software.

If you would like to join the conversation, please join us on
