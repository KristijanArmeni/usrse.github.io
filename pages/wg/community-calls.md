# Overview

The Community Calls working group plans monthly virtual meetings to promote community connections and
share information on topics of interest to US-RSE members. We usually have a brief speaker or two, followed
by some time spent in breakout rooms discussing the topic of the month. Topics are chosen from a [GitHub
Issues list](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues); we encourage everyone in the 
community to submit ideas for future topics as Issues on this list.

In order to accommodate as many different schedules as possible, Community Calls are held on different days 
and times in odd and even months. During odd months (January, March, May, July, September, November), 
calls take place 12:00-1:00PM ET on the second Thursday of the month. During even months (February, April, June,
August, October, December), calls take place 2:00-3:00PM ET on the second Friday of the month.

Information on upcoming calls and past topics can be found in the [Community Calls](https://us-rse.org/events/#community-call) 
section of the [US-RSE Events page](https://us-rse.org/events/).
