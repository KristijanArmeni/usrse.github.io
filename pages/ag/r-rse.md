# Overview
The R Affinity Group exists to increase the representation of R users in the US-RSE community and provide opportunities for members to develop R skills.

# Membership
Membership is open to anyone who is interested in learning more about R, participating in a community of R users, or improving their R skills. 

# Activities

The R Affinity Group will identify 3 to 4 projects per year for members to work on. The purpose of these projects is to help members grow their R skills together or individually.
 
The R Affinity Group will facilitate outreach opportunities to advocate for research software engineering as a career path among R users and bring more R users into the US-RSE community.
