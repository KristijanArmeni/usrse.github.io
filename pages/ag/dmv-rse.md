# Overview

DMV (Delaware-Maryland-Viriginia) RSE is a regional affinity group for professionals in RSE (and RSE-adjacent) disciplines serving as an informal gathering for interested professionals to connect, learn about and advocate for RSE (local initiatives and broadly).  

# Membership

DMV-RSE is open to anyone who considers themselves a research software engineer and work or are otherwise professionally active in the DMV area, regardless of job title or domain. This includes workers in academic research (students, postdocs, and professors), as well as RSE professionals in government, industry and other sectors (e.g. non-profit orgs).  

Membership is open to all [US-RSE members](https://us-rse.org/join/).

To join, contact one of the coordinators on the US-RSE slack (see the [Questions?](#questions) section below).

# Activities

We primarily organize in-person meetups (approximately every 2-3 months) hosted at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology in Washington DC. Each meetup consists of an invited talk by a guest speaker on a focused RSE topic with time for networking before and after. The event is followed by a happy hour in a nearby bar.
