The US Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE) is the leading professional community of research software engineering 
practitioners in the United States. Its mission is to empower a diverse workforce of Research Software Engineers (RSEs) through 
advocacy for the crucial role of RSEs in driving research discoveries, professional development, collaboration, and 
to establish a recognized profession. US-RSE envisions a future where it plays an essential role for RSEs to be universally 
respected for advancing science, technology, and society through the transformative power of research software engineering.
