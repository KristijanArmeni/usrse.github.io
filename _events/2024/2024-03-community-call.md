Our **March Community Call** will be all about **The Wide World of RSE Positions** on Thursday, March 14, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT.

Research software engineers come in all shapes and sizes. Some work as “service RSEs”, some are in postdoc positions, some are staff members; some work in teams, some are lone wolfs, some have a buddy or work across units. In our March community call, we would like to explore the different positions RSEs are in to understand better how our community is made up and how US-RSE can support the different needs of its members. Come and join us if you want to learn more about how other people got to where they are, what other RSEs’ work situations look like, or just to hang out with your fellow US-RSE members.
