Our **September Community Call** will be all about **GPU Frameworks** on Thursday, September 12, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT.

What can they do for you? What canâ€™t they do? When should you be using one? What even are GPU frameworks?

Whether you are looking to add GPU support to an existing codebase or want to create a new GPU-capable application we will discuss different available options. Some common options include: 
- Directives based (OpenACC, OpenMP-Target)
- Library based (Kokkos, alpaka, etc.)
- Vendor language extensions (CUDA, HIP, SYCL)
- Rely on other existing frameworks (e.g. pytorch)

Come join us to learn and discuss with the US-RSE community!
