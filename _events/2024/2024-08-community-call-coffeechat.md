Our **August Community Call** will be a **Community Coffee Chat** on Friday, August 9, at 2pm ET/1pm CT/12pm MT/11am PT.

With the summer coming to a close, we will be taking a pause from technical topics this month to do a community-wide coffee chat. There will be games and fun, or if you want to learn something new about your fellow US-RSE members, you can opt to have some open-ended conversations in a breakout room. No matter what, itâ€™ll be a great way to wind down the week. Come join us!
