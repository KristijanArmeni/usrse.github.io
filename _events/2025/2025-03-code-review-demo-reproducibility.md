#### Title

Code Review Demo: Reproducibility Audits

#### Description

This is the first in a series of code review demos hosted by the US-RSE code
review working group.
In this demo, we will discuss reproducibility audits, a broad (and shallow)
type of code review focused on the following questions: Can I figure out how to
get the code to run?
Does the code produce the expected outputs?
How readable and re-usable is the code?
This type of code review can be useful before submitting a manuscript with
associated analysis code, or in the context of a “ReproHack”.
