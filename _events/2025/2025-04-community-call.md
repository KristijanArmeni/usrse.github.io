Our **April Community Call** will be all about **Git Branching Strategies and Continuous Integration Tools** on Friday, April 11, at 2pm ET/1pm CT/12pm MT/11am PT.

Let’s preface this month’s topic by saying that we assume you are using Git and GitHub or GitLab. (If not, you should absolutely join this call and learn what that is and why you should use it!) What is your favorite Git branching strategy? How does it work with your continuous integration tools? Do you live in a labyrinth of branches or do you work from main? How long do your branches live? Have you been in merge hell, and how did you get out? How did your continuous integration tools help you get out of a messy code situation? Join us for April’s community call to talk nerdy about Git, continuous integration tools, and everything related!
