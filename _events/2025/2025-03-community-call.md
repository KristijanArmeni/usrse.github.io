Our **March Community Call** will be all about **Code Review for Research Software** on Thursday, March 13, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT.

Do you do code review? Within your team, with a colleague, by yourself? In this month’s community call we will talk about how much fun it is to get your code reviewed, how to do it, what tools can help with it, and all the benefits of it! Wild guess, most of us will probably use GitHub and pull requests as our main tool for code review, but there are others out there… right? Aren’t there? If you use something fancy, if you use plain old GitHub/GitLab pull/merge requests, or if you do it by hand, we want to hear from you! And if you have never even heard of code reviews, you should for sure join us!
