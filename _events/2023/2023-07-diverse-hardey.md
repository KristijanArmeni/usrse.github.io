Our next speaker in the DiveRSE series is Mariann (Maz) Hardey, Professor of
Digital Culture, Technology and Business at Durham University Business School.
Mariann is also a member of Advanced Research Computing (ARC) at Durham, where
her role supports widening participation and accessibility in computing. She
is passionate about self-development and learning, with a focus on
representation among business leaders and practitioners in the technology
sector. One of her latest books “The Culture of Women in Tech” forms part of

In her talk, Mariann will focus on the ‘Whoddunit’ behind Equality, Diversity
and Inclusion (EDI/DEI) in the tech workplace. To best serve these fundamental
principles, one must first understand the mechanics behind it.
