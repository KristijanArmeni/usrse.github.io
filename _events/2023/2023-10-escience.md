This workshop is to be held as part of [eScience 2023](https://www.escience-conference.org/2023/),
which will be held **IN-PERSON**.

Research Software Engineers (RSEs) combine professional software engineering
expertise with an intimate understanding of research. They are uniquely placed
in the eScience ecosystem to ensure development of sustainable research
environments and reproducible research outputs. However, the position of RSEs
within eScience is still not fully established, with many RSEs not gaining proper
recognition for their contributions and struggling to find a way to progress their
careers. The theme of this workshop is sustainable RSE ecosystems, encompassing
both the role of RSEs in sustainable eScience and making the RSE ecosystem
itself more sustainable. We intend for this workshop to raise awareness of the
concept of research software engineers and research software engineering (RSEng),
as well as to provide an opportunity for RSEs and those interested in RSEng to
talk about issues and solutions. Anyone involved or interested in RSEng is
welcome to attend. 

The first half of our workshop will consist of a series of invited talks and
interactive question/answer. The second half of the program will be discussion-based
breakouts. We will produce a blog post after the workshop that discusses the
talks and the breakouts. 

The workshop is October 11th from 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM EEST.
