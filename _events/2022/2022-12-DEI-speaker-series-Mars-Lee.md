## Drawing the Future: Making Scientific Python More Accessible with Comics

The 
[US-RSE Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Working Group (DEI-WG)](https://us-rse.org/wg/dei/) 
is proud to
present the next talk in the US-RSE DEI Speaker Series, from 
**[Mars Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mars-lee/)**.

**Date/Time: December 14, 2022 3:00-4:00 ET (12:00-1:00 PT)**

**[Register Now!](https://emory.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0pfumqrTwtGt2Ye4pUjOHFpWd2_bTNzHJ2)**

### Abstract

Comics are an unexpected but incredibly powerful medium! Through illustrations, story and humor, comics invite under-represented groups into open source software (OSS) and introduce new topics.

This talk will highlight the speaker’s recent comic: 
[“How to Write Alt Text For Scientific Diagrams and Documentation”](https://heyzine.com/flip-book/f3c7f85cdc.html). 
By breaking down accessibility concepts into byte-sized pieces, 
readers learn, laugh, and bring back actionable steps to their own OSS projects.

But how did an illustrator end up in the Scientific Python space in the first place? 
Find out as the speaker recounts her journey from outsider to collaborator. 
She lays out the intensely collaborative comic-making process, from discussion with domain experts, 
translating technical concepts, drawing, and printing.

She also highlights how deliberate community-building and funding of DEI set the ground for her work. 
Specifically, the structural and cultural changes in the NumPy community funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) grants.

Through this give and take, this talk aims for attendees to understand the power of design in OSS. 
And ultimately, for attendees of all skill sets to start doodling their own comics!

## US-RSE DEI-WG Speaker Series

The US-RSE Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Working Group (DEI-WG) is working
