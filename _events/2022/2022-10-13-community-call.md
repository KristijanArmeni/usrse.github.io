This monthâ€™s community call will be dedicated to the International RSE Day! Because of that it will be held on Thursday, October 13 at 12pm ET instead of Friday.

The topic of the call will be to review the outcomes of the Princeton Community Building Workshop that was held earlier this year and to discuss next steps. 
You might have already read some of the blog posts from workshop working groups. 
If you want to hear more about what was discussed or want to get involved, join us for an hour of community building and interaction!

#### Registration details
Information on how to register for the Zoom meeting will be sent via email
and posted in the #general channel on Slack.
