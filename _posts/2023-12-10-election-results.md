After 108 votes, the results of the 2023 Steering Committee Election are in.  The five candidates elected to a two-year term are:

* Abbey Roelofs
* Alex Koufos
* Ian Cosden
* Jeff Carver
* Keith Beattie

We extend a warm welcome to the three new members joining the [Steering Committee](/about/steering-committee/) and express our excitement in having Ian and Jeff continue their contributions for the next two years. For more details about the newly elected members, please refer to their [candidate information](/2023-11-10-sc-candidates).

A heartfelt thank you goes out to our exceptional candidates David Beck, Mahmood Shad, and Torin White for their pivotal role in ensuring the success of the election. All of them have helped to grow US-RSE and make it successful.  We look forward to their continued contributions.  

In addition, we wish to express our sincere appreciation to the outgoing Steering Committee members - Nicole Brewer, Christina Maimone, and Sandra Gesing - who, while choosing not to run for re-election this year, have left an indelible mark on US-RSE. Their decades of experience have been instrumental in expanding US-RSE, fostering connections within the broader research software community, and positioning US-RSE for a promising future.
