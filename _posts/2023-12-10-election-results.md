After 108 votes, the results of the 2023 Steering Committee Election are in.  The five candidates elected to a two-year term are:

* Abbey Roelofs
* Alex Koufos
* Ian Cosden
* Jeff Carver
* Keith Beattie

We're excited to welcome three new members to the [Steering Committee](/about/steering-committee/) and to have Ian and Jeff back for two more years.  Learn more about the new members from their [candidate information](/2023-11-10-sc-candidates).

Thanks to our other excellent candidates David Beck, Mahmood Shad, and Torin White for making the election a success.  All of them have helped to grow US-RSE and make it successful.  We look forward to their continued contributions.  

We also want to thank three outgoing Steering Committee members who did not participate in the election, Nicole Brewer, Christina Maimone and Sandra Gesing.  They brought decades of experience to grow US-RSE, connect it to the broader research software community, and set US-RSE up for a bright future.
