**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

I want to join the US-RSE Steering Committee to advocate for research software engineers (RSEs) who, like myself, develop and maintain scientific software for domain scientists. I understand firsthand the challenges faced by RSEs, from securing proper recognition to establishing the impact of our work. My aim is to help RSEs gain the acknowledgment they deserve, particularly by promoting scientific software as validation artifacts in performance reviews. Additionally, I am interested in addressing the evolving role of AI in scientific research and its implications for the RSE community.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

I would like to contribute to the broader RSE community by fostering collaboration and advocating for recognition. One of my primary goals would be to create domain- and technique-based groups within existing communication channels, with maintainers for each group, while encouraging "campfire-style" discussions. This informal but structured approach is intended to facilitate cross-institution collaboration, enabling RSEs to share knowledge, identify common challenges, and work together on innovative solutions.

I am also committed to exploring new methods for acknowledging RSE contributions, with a focus on increasing visibility for their work. This includes advocating for the inclusion of RSE achievements in institutional performance reviews and promotion processes, as well as finding opportunities to publicly celebrate impactful scientific software projects. Through these efforts, I aim to help elevate the profile of RSEs and highlight the essential role of software in advancing scientific research.

Furthermore, I would like to enhance the RSE community's connectivity, whether through online forums, community meetups, or contributions to open-source RSE resources. I also plan to initiate discussions about generative AI in the RSE community, exploring how it can be leveraged to promote RSE roles while mitigating potential negative impacts on entry-level RSE work. These initiatives are intended to help build a supportive network where RSEs can thrive and receive the recognition they deserve.

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

I am drawn to the US-RSE Steering Committee because I believe deeply in creating an RSE community where everyone feels they belong, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds. My time as Co-Chair of Diversity and a member of the Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee for the 2024 US-RSE Conference was a transformative experience. It showed me how intentional spaces of respect and support can uplift individuals, making them feel seen and valued. I want to carry this commitment forward, helping US-RSE become a home where BIPOC RSEs and others who might feel on the margins find empowerment. With my background in AI and open science, I hope to guide policies that honor our diverse voices and strengthen our collective impact, fostering a future where all RSEs feel welcomed and inspired to thrive.


**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

 Building on my commitment to fostering community and inclusivity, my contributions to the US-RSE Association are centered on creating spaces that allow RSEs to connect, learn, and thrive together. As Co-Chair for the Diversity Committee, I led efforts to create pre-conference sessions aimed at welcoming and supporting a diverse group of attendees. These sessions provided guidance and opportunities to address unique challenges, and through them, I built meaningful connections with members that deepened during the conference. My suggestion to offer professional headshots also helped make the conference a more memorable, supportive experience, bringing an innovative touch that attendees appreciated.

Locally, I extended this sense of connection by creating the Seattle Affinity Group and organizing Seattle RSE Meetups. These gatherings have become spaces where RSEs share their journeys and feel a genuine sense of belonging, reinforcing the idea that we grow stronger as a collective. My blog amplifies this mission, addressing challenges BIPOC RSEs face and ensuring diverse voices are heard and valued.

In all my efforts, I strive to build a resilient, inclusive RSE community that empowers each member to engage fully, feel represented, and thrive in both their work and community.

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

I am dedicated to advancing the Research Software Engineering (RSE) community by fostering collaboration, growth, and sustainable operations. As Senior Program Manager for Purdue’s new RSE Center, I’ve led efforts to enhance both internal and external engagement. I’m particularly driven to represent RSE needs across academic institutions, especially in the Midwest, and have worked closely with institutions like Notre Dame to build synergies that benefit the broader RSE community. If you were to ask those who’ve worked with me, they’d say I bring charisma and clear communication to every project. On the US-RSE Steering Committee, I aim to expand this work nationally, shaping the future of RSE to be inclusive, forward-thinking, and aligned with the evolving needs of research and industry. Although skilled in the black and white of business, the grey excites me most—that’s where I see opportunities to turn US-RSE from good to great.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

My contributions to the RSE community span leadership, development, and strategy. At Purdue, I helped establish the RSE Center, creating scalable models, working with faculty, and developing funding mechanisms for long-term RSE growth. Collaborating with institutions like Notre Dame, I’ve promoted partnerships to improve Indiana’s research infrastructure. I’m passionate about connecting people and fostering synergies across research centers, seeing firsthand how shared resources drive innovation. This is evident in my role with the RSE Group Leaders, volunteering at PEARC, and connecting with the European RSE organization. At SC, I’m presenting “Self-Sustaining Operational Models in RSE” and leading a workshop on agile project management for 70+ young professionals, sharing my vision for scalable RSE practices internationally. As a US-RSE Steering Committee member, I’ll leverage my expertise to expand RSE across the U.S., knowing that, as Aristotle said, “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”


## Julia (U-lia) Damerow (she/her)

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

As it is the case for many RSEs, my career path was more of a winding road than a straightforward path. It was not until after I finished my PhD that I realized there were others like me—people that worked in research but were passionate about writing good software—and that what we were doing had a name! I envision a future in which students are not only aware of the RSE profession but also have clear guidance on pursuing it. I am convinced that US-RSE plays a vital role in achieving this vision, and I am passionate about contributing to its success. With a foot in complexity science and the other in digital humanities, I would like to be a voice for digital humanities RSEs, who often face unique challenges. I’m currently a member of the US-RSE Steering Committee and this is the end of my second term. I would like to continue to serve on the Steering Committee to support the efforts of this amazing community and its members for another two years.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

I have been on the US-RSE Steering Committee since 2021 and have served as its treasurer since 2022. In this role, I have supported US-RSE's transition to our current fiscal sponsor, Community Initiatives (CI), and continue to work closely with CI on financial matters for US-RSE. I co-organize US-RSE’s monthly community calls, contribute as a member of both the Education and Training Working Group and the Code Review Working Group, and have co-organized the US-RSE Virtual Workshops in 2021 and 2022. In 2023, I co-chaired the first US-RSE conference, and as treasurer, I was also involved in the financial aspects of US-RSE’24. In addition to my work with US-RSE, I serve on the steering committee of DHTech, a community of people doing technical work in digital humanities. DHTech hosts virtual meetups, conference workshops, and a bi-monthly newsletter. I am also actively involved in the DHTech Community Code Review Working Group, where we organize code reviews for digital humanities projects. As Lead Scientific Software Engineer at Arizona State University, I developed a course on research software engineering fundamentals that introduces graduate students to essential software engineering best practices and technologies. I also work extensively with student workers, mentoring them in software development. While most of them move on to work for tech companies after graduation, they learn about the research software engineering profession through their work with me.

## Kenton McHenry

[Email](mailto:mchenry@illinois.edu), [Profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/kenton-mchenry)

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

For over 35 years, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) has provided crucial support for software development in research, with demand for these services only increasing as software becomes essential in nearly every scientific discipline. While NCSA has contributed significantly to impactful software advancements, those responsible for these achievements often faced challenges in job security, career development, recognition, and general support. Over the past 15 years, I have worked to address these needs within NCSA. About 6 years ago, through my introduction to the UK and US Research Software Engineering (RSE) communities, I recognized that these challenges extended well beyond NCSA. Since then, I have actively engaged in these communities, gaining insights into shared goals and best practices. I wish to continue serving on the US RSE Steering Committee, contributing the lessons learned at NCSA and helping raise awareness of this vital RSE role across academia.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

I have long bemoaned to my coworkers and bosses on how software is not treated nearly as seriously as it should be in science. And not just the software but the people who create and run it are often not recognized proportionally to the impact their work has on the scientific results. Finally putting some “skin in the game”, I started an informal “CSE Cabal” at LBL (CSE is the job title for Software Engineers) to support and build a community of RSEs. I’m now turning that into an LBL-RSE affiliate group. Having made some traction with upper management at LBL, I am now the lead of a new Sustainable Software Engineering group with 6 RSEs working across multiple scientific disciplines. This came as a result of me successfully demonstrating, over the course of several years, the importance and impact of having a funded “Software Engineering” effort on multiple DOE projects.

I’ve been an active member of the BSSw and US-RSE for several years now, participating in meetings and producing content for web sites and working groups.  Most recently, I led a Birds of a Feather session at the US-RSE23 conference on “What it means to be an RSE at a National Lab” where we explored the differences between and challenges faced by RSE at various National Labs.

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

My journey to research software engineering has been a winding road, coming from a background in computer science and psychology and landing in an RSE-adjacent role as a programmer analyst. I now work in a lab that does neuroimaging and TBI research at a medical academic institution. I’ve always valued interdisciplinary work and strive to make our lab practices and code base more approachable for students and investigators alike. As I’ve grown in this role, I’ve come to appreciate the importance of RSEs in the medical research environment and recognize a need for awareness and support in this domain.

As a member of the steering committee, I would bring a fresh perspective from a medical academic institution, as well as experience working in smaller local communities. I’m excited for the trajectory of the US-RSE and want to continue participating and advocating for folks in and out of the space. 

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

Since joining the US-RSE in 2022, I’ve contributed to several working groups and volunteered during both conferences. As part of the Outreach group, I wrote up a small Slack workflow to greet new members and orient them to the workspace. I also participated in the reshaping of the Code of Conduct, volunteered as a Code of Conduct officer at both US-RSE conferences, and currently serve on the Code of Conduct enforcement committee. I’ve been involved in the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion working group, where I’ve participated in coming up with initiatives and writing blog posts. I’ve also been working to help establish an Institutional RSE Networking group for those folks who don’t necessarily have direct support or a formal group for RSEs at their institution and want to build up community within their organization.

Outside of the US-RSE, I work with medical, undergraduate, and graduate students that rotate through our research lab and have the unique opportunity to expose them to RSE techniques and ideas (and the US-RSE). While not directly related to the RSE community, I’m actively working in my department’s Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion group and serving on the steering committee for the local LGBTQ+ Alliance in my county. These community experiences continually inform my interactions with RSEs both at my institution and in the US-RSE.

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

 As a current member of the Steering Committee, I have gotten to experience and help guide the movement of US-RSE during what we’ve been calling the “Season of Precedents.” From the first two years of official conferences to the overhaul of the Code of Conduct, from hiring our first paid staff to the creation of multiple resource guides, from the formation of the Community and Travel Funds program to new strategic collaborations, US-RSE’s direction and changes are thrilling.

The work is not done yet. I’d like to continue to help US-RSE grow into an even stronger association for its community members. In the next term, I am dedicated to ensuring sustainable processes for staff, programs, and collaborations, as well as upholding our mission and continuing to provide a welcoming place for RSEs around the country and globe to connect and grow.
 
**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

I have been a member of US-RSE since 2020 and have been an active member of multiple working groups including Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; Outreach; and the Group Management Working Group. In previous years I have organized workshops, such as RSEs in eScience, and led multi-institution collaborations between RSEs within US-RSE to publish papers in Computational Science and Engineering (CISE) and in response to Requests for Information (RFIs). In the last two years as a member of the Steering Committee, I was one of the architects of the Community and Travel Funds program, the first open-to-all-members avenue for the community to request funds for community and individual purposes, and contributed heavily to many precedential decisions (as well as coining the term “Season of Precedents”). Additionally, I acted as the co-General Chair for US-RSE’24 in Albuquerque, NM, our second conference in what will hopefully be a very long and fruitful series, which received stellar reviews and feedback from the overall community. Outside US-RSE, I lead a Research Software Engineering Community of Practice within Sandia National Laboratories. In my “day job,” I act as both a researcher and practitioner with a focus on software engineering for scientific projects and fundamental research into research software engineering topics such as reproducibility and testing.
