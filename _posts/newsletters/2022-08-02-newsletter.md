# **Steering Committee Recap**

US-RSE [Steering Committee meeting minutes](https://us-rse.org/about/steering-committee/) are public, but we doubt many people read them!  So to increase transparency and share information more broadly, we're adding a section to the newsletter to recap recent discussions and activities. 
    
In May, June, and July, the Steering Committee focused on:
    
* Planning and coordinating events
    * Planning for the [Virtual Workshop](https://us-rse.org/virtual-workshop-2022/)
    * Details of being an exhibitor at the SC22 Conference
    * Initial planning for an in-person RSE conference in 2023
    * ADSA/US-RSE Career Workshop
    * International RSE Day
    * US-RSE Annual General Meeting and election 
* Follow-up tasks from the April community building workshop, including getting blog posts written, distributing remaining resources from the conference, and coordinating with those who agreeded to lead specific efforts.  See the [News](https://us-rse.org/news/) section of the website for three posts that resulted from the community building workshop so far.
* Logistics for working groups: their interactions with the Steering Committee and how individual working groups are structured and operate
* Updates on the activities of existing working groups and plans for new groups
* Discussing how to involve the community in revising Code of Conduct procedures
* US-RSE's financial status and resources
* Initial discussions on whether an advisory board separate from the Steering Committee might be useful for US-RSE

# **US-RSE Virtual Workshop 2022 - September 14&16, 2022**

The theme of the 2022 US-RSE Virtual Workshop is “**Make it happen! Towards a diverse and sustainable future!**” The workshop will feature talks, and breakout group sessions. It will be held via Zoom and some parts, such as the talks, will be recorded and available after the workshop via the US-RSE YouTube channel. The workshop will be free but registration will be required.
 
The workshop will be held on two non-consecutive half days: September 14 and 16, 2022, 1-4pm ET/12-3pm CT/11am-2pm MT/10am-1pm PT.
All information related to the workshop can be found on the [workshop website](https://us-rse.org/virtual-workshop-2022/).

<a name="elections"></a>
# **Steering Committee Elections**
    
[Yearly elections](https://us-rse.org/about/election/) for the Steering Committee are happening this fall.  Self-nominations are encouraged and will be due by November 4th.  Thinking of becoming a candidate?  There's a new [Candidate Guidance](https://us-rse.org/2022-07-01-candidate-guidance/) document created by attendees of the Community Building workshop and the DEI working group.  Check it out for details on what Steering Committee members actually do, suggestions for building experience relevant to the Steering Committee, and ideas for writing a compelling candidate statement that will let others know why you’d make a great addition to the Steering Committee.

# **RSE-HPC-2022 Workshop at SC22**

**Submission deadline is Friday, August 5!**

We are excited to announce the Research Software Engineers in HPC Workshop (RSE-HPC-2022) to be held as part of [SC22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/) (hybrid event, in Dallas, TX and virtually). This will be a half-day workshop 2:00pm-5:30pm CST (UTC-6), Sunday, November 13, 2022.

This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world, to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders.  We’ll discuss the current activities and plans of national RSE organizations, discuss the needs of RSEs and RSE groups, and brainstorm ways RSE organizations can help address these.

We encourage prospective participants to submit position papers (limit of 2 pages, not counting references; no format prescribed) on topics related to RSE issues. Papers and discussion topics should be submitted using the [submission website](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=Submit&id=SC22WorkshopRSEHPC2022Submission&site=sc22). The deadline for submissions is Friday, August 5, 2022, at 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12).

For more information, see the [workshop website](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2022/) or [contact the organizers](mailto:sc-ws-rse-hpc@info.supercomputing.org).

# **Interesting Reads or Podcasts**

Items you may have missed on the blog and Slack:

* <span style="color: black;"> A year ago, PLOS Computational Biology introduced a [new journal policy](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867) requiring authors to make public any code directly related to the results of their article upon publication of the work. This [blog](https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/uphold-the-code/) explores the drivers behind this policy change. </span>
