**Call for Submissions**

We invite submissions for [USRSE'25](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/), the third annual conference from the United States Research Software Engineer Association ([US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/)), to be held in **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 6-8, 2025**. 

Do you write code for your research? Are you curious about career paths available to computational researchers? If so, USRSE‚Äô25 is the perfect venue to showcase your work\!

Whether you‚Äôre a data scientist, digital humanist, scientific programmer, software developer, or research software user, US-RSE is where people at the intersection of code and research come together. The USRSE'25 conference is your chance to connect with peers, mentors, and experts in the fast-growing world of research software. Don‚Äôt just take our word for it‚Äî100% of last year's post-conference survey respondents said they would return and recommend the conference to others.

This year‚Äôs conference theme is ‚ÄúCode, Practices, and People.‚Äù Submission formats include Birds of a Feather (BoFs), workshops, short talks (including papers, talk abstracts, and notebooks), and posters. **The submission deadline for all formats (except posters) is May 2, 2025\.** Poster submissions are due July 20, 2025\. 

Visit the [conference website](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/) for further details including:

## ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**2. Our Executive Director Sandra Gesing was at Capitol Hill!**ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

> This week, I had the opportunity to visit Capitol Hill for a series of energizing and insightful meetings with congressional staff. The atmosphere was buzzing‚Äîwith long lines to get into the buildings and not much seating beyond the occasional restroom bench! I met with staff members from the offices of Senator Adam Schiff, Senator Richard Durbin, Representative John Garamendi, Representative Mike Thompson, and Representative Ken Calvert. We had thoughtful conversations about the critical role of workforce development, nonprofit organizations‚Äô impact, and Research Software Engineers‚Äô growing importance. It was a great first step in getting US-RSE on their radar.

<a name="sc-update"></a>
# üíº**3. Steering Committee Updates**üíº  

The newsletter may have been taking a break for the past few months, but the Steering Committee wasn't! Starting in January, we welcomed our newest SC member Cordero Core, reviewed our SC roles, and added new internal roles for Conference Liaisons and chairs for the Awards and Community Funds Working Groups. Ian Cosden remains the Steering Committee Chair, and the full list of roles is available on the [website](https://us-rse.org/about/steering-committee/). 

January also brought many changes in the political and research climate, and the SC devoted much of our meeting time to discussing how to address these issues within the organization. Initial community feedback suggested the preferred way forward is to continue with our current policies while keeping an eye on the situation and continuing to listen to community input and concerns. 

Two notable events happened in the first couple months of the year. First, in February the SC and Executive Director held our annual strategic planning meeting; you can read more about what we focused on and future plans in an upcoming blog post on the topic. Second, in support of the Organizational Membership program, a subset of the Steering Committee supported our Executive Director's first meeting with representatives from organizational members, where we received valuable feedback from these organizations.

In addition to the above, we've been working on a number of other efforts. These include:
* Collaborating with our USRSE'25 Conference Chairs in support of our annual fall conference.
* Acting on updates from our Executive Director about ongoing work with ONet, fundraising, and our Organizational Membership program. 
* Defining and documenting processes for governance and administration of the US-RSE organization to ensure smooth transitions of responsibilities in the future.
* Hiring a part-time student to take over some administrative tasks, including compiling this newsletter!

# üôå**5. Organizational Founding Membership**üôå  

US-RSE envisions a future where Research Software Engineers are universally respected for advancing science, technology, and society through the transformative power of research software engineering.
We‚Äôre excited to share that the momentum around our Organizational Founding Membership continues to grow! See the list below for the current members (six more are onboarding at the moment).

Organizations that join on or before November 30, 2025, will be recognized in perpetuity as founding members. Founding organizations will also lock in current membership fees through December 31, 2028.
Organizational support helps sustain and expand vital community offerings, including the annual conference, monthly calls and newsletter, job board, working groups, and new resources.
