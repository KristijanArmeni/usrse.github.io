# **1. US-RSE Conference 2025 (USRSE'25)**  

**Call for Submissions**

We invite submissions for [USRSE'25](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/), the third annual conference from the United States Research Software Engineer Association ([US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/)), to be held in **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 6-8, 2025**. 

Do you write code for your research? Are you curious about career paths available to computational researchers? If so, USRSE’25 is the perfect venue to showcase your work\!

Whether you’re a data scientist, digital humanist, scientific programmer, software developer, or research software user, US-RSE is where people at the intersection of code and research come together. The USRSE'25 conference is your chance to connect with peers, mentors, and experts in the fast-growing world of research software. Don’t just take our word for it—100% of last year's post-conference survey respondents said they would return and recommend the conference to others.

This year’s conference theme is “Code, Practices, and People.” Submission formats include Birds of a Feather (BoFs), workshops, short talks (including papers, talk abstracts, and notebooks), and posters. **The submission deadline for all formats (except posters) is May 2, 2025\.** Poster submissions are due July 20, 2025\. 

Visit the [conference website](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/) for further details including:

- Technical topics of interest aligned with the conference theme (see last year’s [program](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/program/) for ideas)  
- Submission formats, templates, and associated deadlines   
- How and where to submit  
- Dates for notification of acceptance and other important dates  
- Venue, hotel, and travel [details](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/attend/) 


Interested in reviewing submissions?  Please volunteer as a reviewer by [filling out this form](https://forms.gle/wj2ufbMJaLB1ExR77) before April 1st. 

Questions about the submission process? Contact [usrse2025@easychair.org](mailto:usrse2025@easychair.org).

# **2. Steering Committee Updates**  

The newsletter may have been taking a break for the past few months, but the Steering Committee wasn't! Starting in January, we welcomed our newest SC member Cordero Core, reviewed our SC roles, and added new internal roles for Conference Liaisons and chairs for the Awards and Community Funds Working Groups. Ian Cosden remains the Steering Committee Chair, and the full list of roles is available on the [website](https://us-rse.org/about/steering-committee/). 

January also brought many changes in the political and research climate, and the SC devoted much of our meeting time to discussing how to address these issues within the organization. Initial community feedback suggested the preferred way forward is to continue with our current policies while keeping an eye on the situation and continuing to listen to community input and concerns. 

Two notable events happened in the first couple months of the year. First, in February the SC and Executive Director held our annual strategic planning meeting; you can read more about what we focused on and future plans in an upcoming blog post on the topic. Second, in support of the Organizational Membership program, a subset of the Steering Committee supported our Executive Director's first meeting with representatives from organizational members, where we received valuable feedback from these organizations.

In addition to the above, we've been working on a number of other efforts. These include:
* Collaborating with our USRSE'25 Conference Chairs in support of our annual fall conference.
* Acting on updates from our Executive Director about ongoing work with ONet, fundraising, and our Organizational Membership program. 
* Defining and documenting processes for governance and administration of the US-RSE organization to ensure smooth transitions of responsibilities in the future.
* Hiring a part-time student to take over some administrative tasks, including compiling this newsletter!

# **5. Community News** 

<a name="partnerships"></a>
### **New Community Partnerships**

We are excited to announce two new partnerships: US-RSE partners with the Research Software Alliance (ReSA) and the Academic Data Science Alliance (ADSA)! The first collaboration unites research software professionals worldwide and both partnerships reinforce our shared commitment to advancing research software and data science, supporting career development, and fostering a sustainable research ecosystem.

Through these partnerships, US-RSE will join ReSA’s and ADSA’s organizations and they will join US-RSE, enhancing collaboration and knowledge exchange. By working together, we are creating new opportunities for joint initiatives, co-hosted events, and greater visibility for research software professionals and data scientists.

### **Our Executive Director Sandra Gesing was at Capitol Hill!**

> This week, I had the opportunity to visit Capitol Hill for a series of energizing and insightful meetings with congressional staff. The atmosphere was buzzing—with long lines to get into the buildings and not much seating beyond the occasional restroom bench! I met with staff members from the offices of Senator Adam Schiff, Senator Richard Durbin, Representative John Garamendi, Representative Mike Thompson, and Representative Ken Calvert. We had thoughtful conversations about the critical role of workforce development, nonprofit organizations’ impact, and Research Software Engineers’ growing importance. It was a great first step in getting US-RSE on their radar.
