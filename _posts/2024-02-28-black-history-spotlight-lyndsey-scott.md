US-RSE's [DEI working group (DEI-WG)](https://us-rse.org/wg/dei/) is proud to
help US-RSE celebrate and participate in Black History Month. Each week during
Black History Month, the US-RSE will spotlight Black/African Americans who have
been involved in computing, science, engineering, and/or math, and have
inspired our members through their accomplishments in their careers and their
personal stories.

## This week's Black History Month spotlight features Lyndsey Scott

As we highlight Black individuals this month who have made contributions in
technology spaces, I was drawn to the story of Lyndsey Scott. I am a fervent
believer in the principle that no one interest should preclude a person from
exploring the totality of who they are. From what I have learned about Lindsey,
she too follows this principle but to a much more impressive degree.

Lyndsey grew up in New Jersey and explored diverse interests including
Taekwondo, theater, and computer science in addition to being an impressive
track athlete. Like many of us, she enjoyed writing games into her Texas
Instruments graphing calculator in middle school and learned Java and C++
during her time at Amherst before branching out into Python and Objective C.
As a programmer, she is perhaps most known for her iOS experience and tutorials.
A recent check of her Stack Overflow profile reveals a reputation of 37180 and
2.1 million users reached.

You might think the above is impressive enough - but she’s also a successful
model! She was the first Black model to sign an exclusive runway contract with
Calvin Klein and has been featured in a variety of magazines along the way.
Many outlets covered her in the early 2010s, though it can be a little
difficult to read some of them due to the way puns like “beauty and a geek”
were overused. However, I think that just reflects on the outlets themselves
and takes nothing away from the achievements and influence Lyndsey can lay
claim to.

In 2022, Lyndsey launched a coding scholarship geared toward LGBTQIA+, women,
and/or BIPOC students majoring in computer science. This is perhaps
unsurprising when you examine the apps in her portfolio, many of which seem geared
towards helping others. As you poke around the links below and learn more about
Lyndsey, I hope you are filled with the same joy and enthusiasm I was; she is
an inspiring speaker and I’m always impressed by people who unapologetically
embrace all of their interests and, in doing so, truly thrive.
