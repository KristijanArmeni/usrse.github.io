US-RSE’s [DEI working group (DEI-WG)](https://us-rse.org/wg/dei/) is proud to
lead the US-RSE’s participation in celebrating [Black History
Month](https://www.blackhistorymonth.gov/).

First up, we’ll be sharing stories throughout the month that recognize and
celebrate African Americans who have inspired our members through their
accomplishments in their careers and their personal stories. We’ll be
publishing these posts throughout February to highlight such people, where we
talk about the person and tie their work and life to the RSE movement.

In addition, we’re excited to host a **Zoom discussion on Thursday, February

YouTube channels with us from Garrison Hayes. We invite you to watch the three
episodes linked below from [Garrison Hayes' YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GarrisonHayes/featured), and then come
prepared for a lively, engaging, and thought provoking conversation with us
over Zoom on Thursday, February 20th and continuing in the [`#dei-discussion`
channel](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C01C8CJQ7AP) on Slack (details and

variety of interesting questions, usually at the intersection of Black history,
politics and current events.
